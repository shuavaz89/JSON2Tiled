# JSON2Tiled
This will convert your Tiled JSON file to the TMX format. Lost your TMX Map Format file (.tmx), but still have the JSON Map Format (.json) of the file? I've built this because somehow I nearly lost all of my .tmx files on my macbook... :'( Fortunately, I have all the json files, this tool managed to convert them to TMX.
